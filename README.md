CS 115 - Intro to Computer Science, python course at Stevens

All the homeworks for the class

###labs

All the labs for the class

All the files from Spring 2015

I'm currently planning on doing all the homeworks and labs over the summer, then doing a "Course by Examination" for the Fall(2015). If I can test out of CS115 I go go straight to CS284 and be closer to back on track after switching my major from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science.

###Other Info

If "foo.txt" is anywhere it's just a palceholder I made to create the folders.
